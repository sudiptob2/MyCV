        <li>Developed an efficient algorithm for masking and feature extraction
          from Rice Leaf images for further detection of diseases in the leaf.
          Later extracted features are used to train neural network to achieve
          more accurate result while detecting disease in rice leaf. We also developed
           an application (in Android) implementing the algorithm which detects
